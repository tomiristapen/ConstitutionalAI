Everyone has the right to own legally acquired property. Ownership and inheritance rights are protected by law. No one may be deprived of property without a court decision, and any forced expropriation for public use must include fair compensation. People are free to engage in economic activities and use their property for legal business purposes. The law regulates monopolies and forbids unfair competition.
